Publish YouTube Workflow Operation
==================================

ID: `publish-youtube`


Description
-----------

The publish YouTube operation publishes a single stream to YouTube. This stream must meet YouTube's format
requirements, and may consist of one audio and/or video stream. If you want to publish both your presenter and presentation
streams we suggest using the [Composite](composite-woh.md) workflow operation handler to prepare a composite file
with both streams inside of it.

### Thumbnails

YouTube has specific restrictions for custom thumbnails:
- The image must be in a supported format (e.g., JPG, PNG).
- The file size must be less than 2MB.
- The YouTube account must be verified with a phone number to upload custom thumbnails.
- For more details, see the [YouTube API documentation](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/thumbnails/set).
